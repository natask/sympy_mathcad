#+TITLE:sympy mathcad
** Motivation
Inspired by https://github.com/mkhan45/CalcuLaTeX.

Wanted something that solved equations as well.

Based on sympy. Utilizes sympy's solve function. Supports sympy syntax like units, pi, integrals and so on.

Look at tips before using.

has both repl and input file version.
** Usage
./sympy_mathcad.py

./sympy_mathcad.py input-file


** Tips
- Enter equations in mathcad like format.
- Make sure terms are separated by space in front and back of the term. 1 * x + y instead of 1*x+y.
- Make sure built-in terms like 'pi', and units like 'newton', DON'T have space in front of the term. like 1*pi intead of 1* pi.
- append "`" to statements you would like sympy to evaluate. This is used to set variables, create units and what ever you find useful.
**  Example
in REPL

./sympy_mathcad.py
#+begin_src python
letter = Quantity("letter")`
word = Quantity("word")`
word.set_global_relative_scale_factor(5,letter)`

gpt_size = 45e12*bit
file_size = 304e5*bit
file_words = 48902*word
gpt_words / gpt_size = file_words / file_size
gpt_words = ?
gpt_words = ? letter
e
#+end_src

- Result ::
#+begin_src python
[{file_size: 30400000.0*bit, file_words: 48902.0*word, gpt_size: 45000000000000.0*bit, gpt_words: 72387828947.3684*word}]
[{gpt_words: file_words*gpt_size/file_size}]
gpt_words  =  7.239e+10*word
gpt_words  =  3.619e+11*letter
#+end_src
